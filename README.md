# Morth
Porth but More.

This repo is kind of a challenge to myself to implement the Porth stack-based concatenative programming language in as many host environments as I can manage. This ended up including some which target C, and can therefore run on anything where C is supported (after compilation).

The implementations are all at varying levels of feature-completeness, so take from that what you will.
